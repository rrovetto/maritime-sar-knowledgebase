## Description

![image](images/International-Database-MarineSAR-Knowledge_Rovetto_v1.jpg)

The goal of this project is to create a globally-accessible database of maritime search and rescue knowledge. It will allow users to search for and contribute SAR information: lessons-learned, best-practices, recommendations, and specific topics such as SAR vehicles and SAR events. In all, this supports an organizations _knowledge management_ strategy in the following ways. The database containing the information expressing knowledge, making the system understood informally as a knowledgebase. With AI knowledge-based approaches, it is formally a knowledgebase. Either single or multiple knowledgebase(s) facilitates _knowledge preservation_ and data archiving. The intertnational scope, accessibility, and contribution potential facilitates _knowledge transfer_ and _knowledge exchange/sharing_; it also afford future data analysis for added _knowledge discovery_. 

## Scope 
Preserving and storing:
- _Essential knowledge & know-how_ for conducting aquatic SAR missions and training. 
- _Implicit knowledge_ held and learned by active, inactive or retired practitioners
- _Data and discoveries_ from datasets or studies
- _Organizational or internal best-practices_
- _101 fundamentals_: essential, transferable, general domain knowledge
- _Interpersonal and Management knowledge_ that facilitates: operations, mission success, positive and safe marine SAR social environments
- _Vehcile & Equipment information_: specifications, etc.
- ... to be added ...

## Status
- In-progress.
- _Seeking_: Partner organizations, investors, sponsors, technological resources, technical service-providers.
- _Project name_: Know-SAR. The name "Know-SAR" has the following meaning. "Know" is short for "Knowledge", minimally pointing to the goal of preserving and sharing SAR knowledge. It also points to innovating in the envisioned AI knowledge-based approach. The pronunciation of the word "know" serves to convey a second meaning: That we aim to achieve a world where there are no SAR events, a state of persistent safety. Toward that ideal state, the project will facilitate sharing of knowledge in order to maximize continuous improvement in SAR operations and research.

"The community stands to improve training by aggregating and sharing maritime SAR information.
This communication discusses two project concepts. One is a project proposal to develop an
international database of maritime SAR best-practices. The other is an ongoing personal project
by the author to develop a bibliography of maritime SAR documents.

The first would be an open-source repository for best-practices in training and in actual 
operations. Any maritime SAR organization, and any individual, would be able to submit
additions to the repository Submitted best-practices or recommendations can be about 
onboard safety aspects to interpersonal aspects to equipment suggestions to detailed 
strategies for particular training evolutions like man-overboard. A best-practices
database can be incorporated into or developed for the IMRF, IMO, or another neutral
organizations.

The second project, an existing compilation of maritime SAR training and standards material is briefly introduced.
Contributions are welcome and should be directed to the author. The author seeks partners and funding to pursue both or either of these 
projects for consolidating maritime SAR information for knowledge sharing and improved training."

“This paper proposes the development of an international database of maritime SAR best-practices. The author (Rovetto) has begun a preliminary repository, drawing on his training and boating experiences. The authors asks the audience if they are interested in contributing to such a repository.  A best-practices database can be incorporated into the IMRF, IMO, or another neutral organization. It should be open and freely accessible. We draw on the collective and diverse experience of the author(s) to offer a list of recommended practices for crew members aboard rescue boats. The practices range from training suggestions, to safety precautions, to managerial and interpersonal approaches. Some maritime SAR organizations employ some of the recommendations, while others do not. Some suggestions may appear obvious, but observing existing paid and unpaid crews will demonstrate gaps in safety, lack of knowledge, etc”
